# Development of the new Brook framework.

* Version number: 4.0
* Codename: Tardigrade
* Core (under [libbrook](https://github.com/risoflora/libbrook/tree/new_api))
    * shared library - dynamic loading, single external file required

# Supported platforms:

* Windows 32 and 64 bit (tested on Windows 7 64 bit)
* Linux 64 bit (tested on Xubuntu 16.04 64 bit)
* ARM 32 bit (tested on ARMv5, Android 5 installed; tested on ARMv7, Android 6 installed)

(future testings: Orange PI i96 256 MB Cortex-A5 32bit with minimal Linux core)

# Suported compilers

Successfully compiled for Windows 32/64 bit and Linux 64 bit using:
* Delphi XE family (tested in Delphi Tokyo)
* Lazarus / Free Pascal (tested in Lazarus 1.8.0 / FPC 3.0.4)

(future testings: Delphi and FPC building for ARM)

# Dependence

* Shared library generated by:
    * GCC (5.4.0+)
    * CLang (5.0.1+)

Planning library distribution:

* APT (Debian based systems)
* Pacman (MinGW)
* MSI (setup for library installation on Windows systems)

# Distribution / installation

* Github branch

Planning package distribution/installation:
 
* Github releasing
* GetIt (Delphi)
* OPM (Lazarus)
* From sources

# Currently available
