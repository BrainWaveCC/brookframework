# Development of the new Brook framework.

* Version number: `4.0`
* Codename: `Tardigrade`
* Core (under [libsagui](https://github.com/risoflora/libsagui) and [libcordel](https://github.com/risoflora/libcordel) statically linked into libbrook)
    * shared library - dynamic loading, single external file required (`libbrook.so`/`libbrook.dll`)

# Supported platforms:

* Windows [32/64 bits]
* Linux [32/64 bits]
* Android [tested on version `7.1.2`; API `24`; ABI `armeabi-v7a`]

(future testings: Orange PI i96 256 MB ARM Cortex-A5 32bit with minimal Linux core)

# Suported compilers

Successfully compiled for Windows 32/64 bit and Linux 64 bit using:
* Delphi XE family (tested in Delphi Tokyo)
* Lazarus / Free Pascal (tested in Lazarus 1.8.0 / FPC 3.0.4)

# Dependence

* Shared library generated by front ends:
    * GCC (latest stable version)
    * CLang (latest stable version)

Planning library distribution:

* APT (Ubuntu repositories)
* Pacman (MinGW-w64 repositories)

# Distribution / installation

* Github branch

Planning package distribution/installation:
 
* Github releasing
* GetIt (Delphi)
* OPM (Lazarus)
* From sources

# Currently available
